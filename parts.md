## Notes

- Pi 4 2GB is plenty — the LLM runs in the cloud, Pi just handles camera capture, audio streaming, and motor control
- Separate power for Pi (power bank) and motors (AA batteries) is recommended to avoid voltage dips crashing the Pi
- If the power bank has auto-shutoff issues at low draw, grab a USB "keep alive" dongle (~$3)
- Some chassis kits include an L298N — check listing to avoid buying it twice
- Display choice matters: small OLED is cheap but tiny, 3.5" LCD gives more room for an expressive face
